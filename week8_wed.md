# Exercise
In this exercise, we will be creating the Base and Derived Class for Shapes and both the Triangle and Rectangle.
* You will create a Base class called Shapes that has setWidth and setHeight, with a Virtual returnArea.
* The Triangle and Rectangle Derived class would only use returnArea.

```cpp 
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>

using namespace std;

int main(){
    //set up rectangle
    //set width and height

    //set up triangle
    //set width and height

    //set shapes vector
    //push back rectangle and triangle

    //output the area of the given shapes

    return 0;
}


```
